Make things dynamic

Uses capistrano to deploy

     Deployment      -> Capistrano
     Gem Management  -> Isolate

Dependencies:

  capistrano
    The capistrano gem is required in order to do deploys of this app.

  isolate
    The isolate gem needs to be installed before you can run the tests
    on this project.

  ffmpeg
     In order for the rvideo gem to work correctly ffmpeg must be installed.
     In order for the asset tests to pass ffmpeg must be installed.

     On OS X I recommend using home brew and doing:

         brew install ffmpeg

This should cover everything you need to get going in a development 
  environment.
